# AntiP2W Bot

This is the source code of my AntiP2W Verification bot.

It checks to make sure someone is a buyer of Qlutch, and if they are it assigns them with a role corresponding with their package.

## Important
This bot is public on GitHub simply to show that it is not malicous, you cannot run it due to it requiring an API URL, and my configuration file.
